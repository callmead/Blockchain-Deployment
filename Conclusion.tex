The idea of smart cities is relatively new and with the rapid advancements in the IoT industry, IoT device performance is increasing which leads to higher data generation resulting in security and privacy risks. Given the breadth of smart city infrastructure, integrating decentralized security architecture, such as Blockchain can be tedious. Therefore, we propose a Blockchain platform that addresses security challenges of the smart city environment. In addition, we provide an automation script as an outcome of this work to allow seamless deployment of Blockchain-based smart city architecture, which saves a significant amount of time compared to the traditional deployment mode. In the future, we aim to incorporate an authentication mechanism to vet the participation of newly joining nodes in the Blockchain network and to develop necessary policies to validate node's transactions before adding them to the Blockchain.
